## Feature: Principled Agent Enhancement

- **Description:** This feature represents the foundational integration of our core philosophical frameworks (Creative Orientation, Structural Thinking, RISE) into the initial set of agent definitions. Each agent was systematically upgraded to move beyond simple task execution and embody these deeper principles, enabling more strategic and context-aware operation.

## Feature: Copilot-Led Agentic Framework Implementation

- **Description:** A significant advancement where the `copilot-swe-agent` autonomously implemented several large-scale agentic systems. This includes the "PersonaHub" for massive-scale persona generation, a "GenAI-Enabled SRL Scaffolding" agent for educational support, and the "Reality-Narrative Integration" framework. This work demonstrates the power of our lattice to orchestrate complex implementations via specialized agents.

## Feature: Agent Role & Knowledge Base Refactoring

- **Description:** A systematic refactoring to enhance the clarity and precision of our agentic roles and their access to information. Roles were renamed to be more descriptive ("The Structural Cartographer," "The Contextual Weaver"), and knowledge base access was updated from static files to a dynamic system, improving modularity and scalability.
