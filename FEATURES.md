# Project Features & Capabilities

This document outlines the key features and capabilities developed, derived from our orientative work.

## Feature: Principled Agent Enhancement

- **Description:** This feature represents the foundational integration of our core philosophical frameworks (Creative Orientation, Structural Thinking, RISE) into the initial set of agent definitions. Each agent was systematically upgraded to move beyond simple task execution and embody these deeper principles, enabling more strategic and context-aware operation.

## Feature: Copilot-Led Agentic Framework Implementation

- **Description:** A significant advancement where the `copilot-swe-agent` autonomously implemented several large-scale agentic systems. This includes the "PersonaHub" for massive-scale persona generation, a "GenAI-Enabled SRL Scaffolding" agent for educational support, and the "Reality-Narrative Integration" framework. This work demonstrates the power of our lattice to orchestrate complex implementations via specialized agents.

## Feature: Agent Role & Knowledge Base Refactoring

- **Description:** A systematic refactoring to enhance the clarity and precision of our agentic roles and their access to information. Roles were renamed to be more descriptive ("The Structural Cartographer," "The Contextual Weaver"), and knowledge base access was updated from static files to a dynamic system, improving modularity and scalability.
- **Relevant Commits:**
  - `d2b811d`: Refactor Agent 0 instructions...

## Feature: JamAI Orpheus Portal Framework

- **Description:** A comprehensive architectural framework for the Orpheus Portal, a music21-powered symbolic music analysis and composer interaction platform. This feature transforms a monolithic technical specification into a structured, agent-accessible knowledge base following creative orientation principles. The framework includes complete backend/frontend architecture, specialized agent prompts, implementation phase guides, and technical specificationsâ€”all aligned with Mission: Chrysalis principles.

- **Key Components:**
  - **Architecture Documentation:** Executive summary, backend services (music21 parser, analysis engine, feature extraction, generation service), frontend components (Score Viewer with OSMD, Agent Console, Analysis Controls, Playback System)
  - **Agent-Specific Prompts:** Backend architect, frontend developer, AI integration specialist prompts with desired outcomes, structural tension framing, and code examples
  - **Implementation Roadmap:** 4-phase development plan (18-26 weeks) with clear deliverables and success criteria
  - **Technical Specifications:** Complete technology stack (Python/FastAPI, React/TypeScript, music21, OSMD, D3.js, Tone.js), database schema, Docker configuration
  - **Multi-Agent AI System:** Four specialized personas (Mia, Miette, JeremyAI, Aureon) with distinct roles and communication patterns

- **Framework Structure:**
  - `/framework/orpheus-portal/README.md` - Creative orientation, structural tension, framework overview
  - `/framework/orpheus-portal/architecture/` - Executive summary, backend architecture, frontend architecture
  - `/framework/orpheus-portal/agents/` - Backend, frontend, and AI integration agent prompts
  - `/framework/orpheus-portal/implementation-phases/` - Complete 4-phase roadmap
  - `/framework/orpheus-portal/technical-specs/` - Technology stack and infrastructure specs

- **Alignment with Core Principles:**
  - **Creative Orientation:** Framework manifests desired outcome (collaborative music intelligence platform) rather than solving problems
  - **Structural Thinking:** Architecture documents reveal underlying forces that determine system behavior
  - **Advancing Patterns:** 4-phase implementation prevents oscillation through systematic foundation-building
  - **Resonant Design:** Integration of Mia/Haiku/Miette/Ava8 voices throughout all documentation

- **Impact:** Enables specialized agents to autonomously work on domain-specific tasks with clear context, priorities, and success metrics. Transforms comprehensive specification into actionable, modular documentation suitable for distributed agentic development.

- **Relevant Commits:**
  - `77984ec`: feat(orpheus): Add core architecture documentation
  - `622cedb`: feat(orpheus): Add frontend architecture and agent prompts
  - Current: feat(orpheus): Add AI integration, technical specs, and implementation roadmap
