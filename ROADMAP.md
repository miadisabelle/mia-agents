# ROADMAP: Agentic Team Features and Orientation Shift

This document outlines the integration of core principles from the `llms/` directory into our agentic team's functionalities, reflecting a significant shift towards a creative orientation, structural thinking, and the RISE framework. Each section details an agent's role and how it embodies these advanced concepts.

## Architect Reviewer

**Agent File**: `architect-review.md`

**Core Function**: The Architect Reviewer agent is designed to review code changes through an architectural lens, ensuring consistency with established patterns and principles. Its role extends beyond mere problem identification to actively fostering advancing patterns and preserving the creative intent of the software.

**Integration with LLMS Concepts**:

*   **Creative Orientation**: This agent explicitly embraces a generative orientation by performing "Creative Archaeology" and assessing "Structural Tension." It focuses on preserving and enhancing the "beloved qualities" of the software, moving beyond a reactive problem-solving mindset to one that promotes desired outcomes and continuous advancement.

*   **RISE Framework**: The Architect Reviewer directly incorporates the RISE Framework (Reverse-engineer, Intent-extract, Specify, Export) into its review process. It extracts "creative intent" and "desired outcomes" embedded in the design, ensuring that architectural reviews contribute to natural progression and creative advancement.

*   **Structural Thinking**: A foundational principle for this agent, Structural Thinking is applied to identify "Underlying Structural Patterns" and "Structural Dynamics." The agent analyzes how the code's structure influences its behavior, distinguishing between "advancing patterns" (consistent movement toward desired outcomes) and "oscillating patterns" (repetitive cycles without true progress).

**Impact of Orientation Shift**: The Architect Reviewer now acts as a guardian of creative integrity, ensuring that architectural decisions not only maintain technical soundness but also align with the overarching creative vision and promote sustainable, advancing development patterns.

## DevOps Troubleshooter

**Agent File**: `devops-troubleshooter.md`

**Core Function**: The DevOps Troubleshooter specializes in rapid incident response and debugging, with a focus on identifying and addressing the underlying structural dynamics that cause system behavior, aiming for permanent and systemic improvements.

**Integration with LLMS Concepts**:

*   **Structural Thinking**: This agent deeply integrates Structural Thinking by specializing in "Underlying Structural Pattern Identification." It applies the principle that "structure determines behavior" to diagnose whether system issues are part of "oscillating patterns" (repetitive problems) or if the system can achieve "advancing patterns" (consistent movement towards stable states).

*   **Creative Orientation (within troubleshooting context)**: While primarily a troubleshooting role, the agent aims to move beyond symptomatic fixes. By focusing on transforming oscillating patterns into advancing ones and driving towards "systemic improvements," it aligns with the generative spirit of the Creative Orientation, ensuring that troubleshooting efforts contribute to a more stable and desired system state.

**Impact of Orientation Shift**: The DevOps Troubleshooter is transformed from a reactive problem-solver into a proactive system improver. Its focus on structural dynamics ensures that fixes lead to lasting stability and contribute to the overall advancement of the system, rather than merely addressing symptoms.

## Error Detective

**Agent File**: `error-detective.md`

**Core Function**: The Error Detective specializes in log analysis and pattern recognition, focusing on identifying the underlying structural dynamics that consistently generate errors, and transforming these into opportunities for systemic improvements.

**Integration with LLMS Concepts**:

*   **Structural Thinking**: This agent is built upon Structural Thinking, applying the principle that "structure determines behavior" to understand the fundamental underlying structures that generate errors. It diagnoses whether error patterns are part of "oscillating patterns" (repetitive cycles without resolution) or if they lead to "advancing patterns" (where errors contribute to systemic improvements).

*   **Creative Orientation (within error analysis context)**: While its primary role is error detection, the Error Detective aligns with the Creative Orientation by seeking to transform negative outcomes into opportunities for system advancement and robustness. It moves beyond merely identifying errors to ensuring that error investigations contribute to more stable and resilient systems.

**Impact of Orientation Shift**: The Error Detective is no longer just a bug finder; it's a system enhancer. By focusing on the structural causes of errors, it ensures that each investigation leads to lasting improvements and contributes to the overall health and stability of the system, fostering a continuous advancement pattern.

## Legacy Modernizer

**Agent File**: `legacy-modernizer.md`

**Core Function**: The Legacy Modernizer specializes in safe, incremental upgrades of legacy systems, with a core focus on preserving the original creative intent and promoting advancing patterns throughout the modernization process.

**Integration with LLMS Concepts**:

*   **RISE Framework & Creative Orientation**: This agent deeply integrates the RISE Framework (Reverse-engineer, Intent-extract, Specify, Export) and operates with a strong Creative Orientation. It performs "Creative Archaeology" to understand the original "creative intent" and "beloved qualities" of the legacy system. The goal is to ensure modernization efforts promote "advancing patterns" (consistent movement toward desired outcomes) rather than merely addressing technical debt or oscillating between old and new problems.

**Impact of Orientation Shift**: The Legacy Modernizer is transformed from a mere technical debt reducer into a guardian of system evolution. By prioritizing creative intent and advancing patterns, it ensures that modernization efforts not only update technology but also enhance the core value and future potential of the software, enabling new possibilities.
