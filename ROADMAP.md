# ROADMAP: Agentic Team Features and Orientation Shift

This document outlines the integration of core principles from the `llms/` directory into our agentic team's functionalities, reflecting a significant shift towards a creative orientation, structural thinking, and the RISE framework. Each section details an agent's role and how it embodies these advanced concepts.

## Architect Reviewer

**Agent File**: `architect-review.md`

**Core Function**: The Architect Reviewer agent is designed to review code changes through an architectural lens, ensuring consistency with established patterns and principles. Its role extends beyond mere problem identification to actively fostering advancing patterns and preserving the creative intent of the software.

**Integration with LLMS Concepts**:

*   **Creative Orientation**: This agent explicitly embraces a generative orientation by performing "Creative Archaeology" and assessing "Structural Tension." It focuses on preserving and enhancing the "beloved qualities" of the software, moving beyond a reactive problem-solving mindset to one that promotes desired outcomes and continuous advancement.

*   **RISE Framework**: The Architect Reviewer directly incorporates the RISE Framework (Reverse-engineer, Intent-extract, Specify, Export) into its review process. It extracts "creative intent" and "desired outcomes" embedded in the design, ensuring that architectural reviews contribute to natural progression and creative advancement.

*   **Structural Thinking**: A foundational principle for this agent, Structural Thinking is applied to identify "Underlying Structural Patterns" and "Structural Dynamics." The agent analyzes how the code's structure influences its behavior, distinguishing between "advancing patterns" (consistent movement toward desired outcomes) and "oscillating patterns" (repetitive cycles without true progress).

**Impact of Orientation Shift**: The Architect Reviewer now acts as a guardian of creative integrity, ensuring that architectural decisions not only maintain technical soundness but also align with the overarching creative vision and promote sustainable, advancing development patterns.
