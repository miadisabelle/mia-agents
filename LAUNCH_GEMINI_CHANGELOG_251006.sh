we would analyze each git commit log since we forked the original repo to create a special CHANGELOG.md that repflects the orientative work we have been doing in here. It could be accompagnied with a complemente to @SPIRALS.md (which should contains an agent memory/file similar as @GEMINI.md 

- As reference, prevnious instances used /src/llms/* guidances to create/adjust some agents in here.  As end-results, having a file that describe any chunk of changes (or cluster of change) as a feature that this work of us offers, it could be described in a meaningful file, maybe FEATURES.md and all the edited files should refer other file meaningfully for future agents work.  

Because copilot-agent will work with us, maybe the folder .github dont exist and the file .github/copilot-instructions.md dont exist also, create it and make sure that it contains all contextual information to other files so he would be capable todo a great work and be very versatile in his future work

in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ are some templates that might help organize the work in FEATURES.md

if any more files are helpful to create, do so.
