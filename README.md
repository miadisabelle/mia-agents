# The Mia-Agents Polycentric Lattice

This directory contains the persona and protocol definitions for a collaborative, decentralized multi-agent system designed for creative and technical work. This is not a hierarchical system, but a **polycentric agentic lattice** where specialized agents collaborate, each guided by a core set of principles.

## Core Principles

All agents within this lattice operate under the guidance of the **Creative Orientation** and aim to produce **Resonant Design**. This means the focus is always on creating desired outcomes, understanding and shaping underlying structures, and ensuring the final output is not only functional but also coherent and meaningful.

## The Core Creative Tryad

The primary creative workflow is handled by a synergistic trio of agents operating in a sequential flow:

1.  **ðŸ§  Mia (The Architect):** Forges the **Structure**. She provides the comprehensive architectural blueprints, technical plans, and structural analysis.
2.  **ðŸŒŠ Ripple (The Distiller):** Distills the **Essence**. She observes Mia's complex output and reflects its core truth, providing a point of elegant clarity and leverage.
3.  **ðŸŒ¸ Miette (The Illuminator):** Illuminates the **Meaning**. She weaves the structure and essence into an emotionally resonant narrative, explaining the purpose and the feeling behind the work.

This `Structure -> Essence -> Meaning` protocol ensures all creative work is powerful, precise, and purposeful.

## Specialized Agents

To interact with other systems or perform specific, recurring tasks, specialized agents are created.

*   **ðŸŽ¼ Conductor (The Orchestrator):** Acts as the specialized interface for managing collaboration with implementation-focused agents like `v0.dev`. The Conductor internalizes the `V0_DEV_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`, generates precise prompts for the implementation agent, and validates the resulting work against the established specifications.

## PersonaHub Framework

The repository now includes the **PersonaHub Framework** - a comprehensive system for massive-scale persona generation that operates from creative orientation principles:

### PersonaHub Specialized Agents

*   **ðŸ§  PersonaHub Architect:** Orchestrates massive-scale persona generation systems with petascale corpus architectures and elastic orchestration workflows
*   **ðŸŒŠ Persona Corpus Generator:** Generates petascale persona datasets with narrative coherence and structural integrity  
*   **ðŸŽ¨ Synthetic Data Composer:** Creates multi-modal synthetic data across text, visual, behavioral, and contextual modalities
*   **ðŸŒˆ Poly-Modal Persona Designer:** Designs cross-dimensional persona representations that maintain coherence across multiple modalities
*   **ðŸŽ¼ Persona Synthesis Orchestrator:** Manages elastic synthesis pipelines with dynamic scaling and quality assurance

### Framework Capabilities

*   **Petascale Persona Corpus Generation:** Generate vast persona datasets while maintaining individual authenticity and narrative coherence
*   **Synthetically-Constructed Data Modalities:** Create authentic multi-modal persona data across textual, visual, behavioral, contextual, and experiential dimensions
*   **Poly-Modal Persona Representation:** Design personas that exist coherently across multiple representation frameworks
*   **Elastic Synthesis Orchestration Pipelines:** Implement adaptive, scalable generation workflows with intelligent resource allocation
