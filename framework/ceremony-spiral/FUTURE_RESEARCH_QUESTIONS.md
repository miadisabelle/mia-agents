# Future Research Questions: Ceremony Spiral Framework

> *These research questions emerged from the Ceremony Spiral framework development and ceremony fragments from 2025-11-06. They represent pathways for advancing both Indigenous technology research and decolonizing computing practice.*

## 1. Community Sovereignty and Technical Infrastructure

### Primary Questions

**Q1.1**: How can distributed systems architecture better support Indigenous data sovereignty while enabling beneficial inter-community connections?

**Context**: Current distributed systems (blockchain, federated networks, etc.) often impose Western concepts of ownership and consensus. Need to explore architectures that honor Indigenous concepts of stewardship, collective responsibility, and relationship-based access control.

**Potential Approaches**:
- Design consensus mechanisms based on Indigenous decision-making protocols
- Explore relationship-based access control vs. role-based
- Investigate how smart contracts could embed cultural protocols
- Research decentralized identity systems that honor collective identity

**Q1.2**: What technical protocols are needed to ensure communities maintain control over their knowledge while participating in broader networks?

**Context**: Tension between sharing knowledge for collective benefit and protecting sacred/sensitive information. Need protocols that enable selective, contextual sharing with ongoing community control.

**Potential Approaches**:
- Dynamic consent mechanisms that can be revoked in real-time
- Contextual encryption where access depends on relationship state
- Knowledge fragmentation where full understanding requires multiple keys held by community
- Time-limited access that automatically expires

**Q1.3**: How can cloud infrastructure honor Indigenous relationships with land while providing necessary computational resources?

**Context**: Cloud computing abstracts infrastructure from place, but Indigenous communities have specific relationships with land. How do we make computing infrastructure place-aware?

**Potential Approaches**:
- Data residency requirements tied to traditional territories
- Edge computing that keeps data processing local to land

**Potential Approaches**:
- Nested ceremony structures (local ceremonies feed into regional, etc.)
- Digital proxies for ceremonial roles at different scales
- Asynchronous ceremony patterns that span time zones
- Video/VR technologies that maintain presence across distance

**Q2.2**: What structural elements preserve relational accountability as technical systems grow in complexity?

**Context**: As systems grow, relationship tracking becomes computationally and socially complex. What mechanisms maintain accountability without overwhelming participants?

**Potential Approaches**:
- Hierarchical relationship abstractions (individual → family → community)
- Periodic relationship audits that sample rather than track everything
- AI-assisted relationship health monitoring with human oversight
- Relationship dashboards that provide summaries while preserving nuance

**Q2.3**: At what scale do advancing spirals risk becoming oscillating patterns, and how do we prevent this transition?

**Context**: Success can breed its own problems. Need to understand tipping points where growth creates structural tensions that reverse advances.

**Potential Approaches**:
