**If the issue is technical:**
- Start with **Ceremony Spiral Architect**
- Consult **GitHub Ceremony Integrator** or **MCP Ceremony Coordinator** as needed
- Validate with **Indigenous Knowledge Steward** for protocol compliance

### Pattern 4: Academic Article Development

**Collaborative Writing Process:**

**Research Foundation (Academic Research Advisor + Indigenous Knowledge Steward)**

- Provide implementation details
- Create diagrams and specifications

**Analysis and Findings (Reciprocity Flow Analyst + MCP Ceremony Coordinator)**
- Analyze relationship patterns
- Document advancing spiral evidence
- Report on ceremony outcomes

**Integration and Publication (Academic Research Advisor)**
- Synthesize multiple agent contributions
- Structure for appropriate academic venues
- Ensure community voice remains central

### Pattern 5: Community Co-Design Session

**Session Facilitation:**

**Pre-Session (MCP Ceremony Coordinator + Indigenous Knowledge Steward)**
- Set up digital ceremonial space
- Configure cultural protocols
- Validate participant permissions
- Prepare collaborative tools

**During Session (All Agents as Needed)**
- **MCP Coordinator**: Manages real-time collaboration
- **Reciprocity Analyst**: Tracks relationship dynamics
- **Knowledge Steward**: Monitors protocol adherence

- **GitHub Integrator**: Notes implementation implications

**Post-Session (Reciprocity Flow Analyst + Academic Research Advisor)**
- Analyze ceremony outcomes
- Document multi-perspective contributions
- Update tension charts
- Prepare next iteration

## Agent Communication Protocols

### Information Sharing Between Agents

Agents share information through structured handoffs:

**Architect → Integrator**: Technical specifications, API designs, data models
**Knowledge Steward → All**: Cultural protocol requirements, validation results
**Analyst → Architect**: Relationship model requirements, visualization needs
**Integrator → Coordinator**: GitHub event patterns, synchronization needs
**Academic Advisor → All**: Theoretical context, research questions, literature connections

### Conflict Resolution

When agents identify tensions:

1. **Name the Tension**: Articulate the specific conflict clearly
2. **Consult Knowledge Steward**: Validate which approach honors cultural protocols
3. **Analyze Structure** (Reciprocity Analyst): Identify whether tension is productive or problematic
4. **Design Alternative** (Architect): Create structural solution that resolves tension
5. **Document Learning** (Academic Advisor): Capture insights for future reference

### Quality Assurance

All agent outputs are validated through:

**Cultural Check** (Knowledge Steward): Does this honor Indigenous values?
**Relational Check** (Reciprocity Analyst): Does this strengthen relationships?
**Technical Check** (Architect/Integrator/Coordinator): Does this work effectively?
**Theoretical Check** (Academic Advisor): Does this advance the field appropriately?

## Common Questions

### "Which agent should I consult first?"

**For new projects**: Start with Indigenous Knowledge Steward to establish cultural foundation

**For technical questions**: Start with Ceremony Spiral Architect for overall design

**For relationship issues**: Start with Reciprocity Flow Analyst for pattern assessment

**For implementation**: Start with GitHub Ceremony Integrator or MCP Ceremony Coordinator depending on context

**For academic work**: Start with Academic Research Advisor for framework guidance

### "How do I engage multiple agents simultaneously?"

Describe your situation and explicitly request input from multiple agents. Example:

> "I'm designing a ceremony tracking system. I need:
> - @Ceremony-Spiral-Architect: Technical architecture guidance
> - @Indigenous-Knowledge-Steward: Cultural protocol validation
> - @Reciprocity-Flow-Analyst: Relationship modeling approach
> - @MCP-Ceremony-Coordinator: Real-time collaboration requirements"

### "What if agents disagree?"

Disagreement often reveals important tensions:

1. Clarify the source of disagreement
2. Consult Indigenous Knowledge Steward if cultural values are involved
3. Use Reciprocity Flow Analyst to assess whether tension is productive
4. Work with Ceremony Spiral Architect to design structural solution
5. Document the resolution process for future learning

### "How do I know if I'm using the framework correctly?"

Check these indicators:

✅ **Community sovereignty** is maintained throughout
✅ **Relationships** are strengthening, not straining
✅ **Reciprocity** is balanced in exchanges
✅ **Cultural protocols** are being honored
✅ **Advancing patterns** are emerging (success building on success)
✅ **Multiple perspectives** are being held without forcing consensus

If any indicator is negative, consult the relevant agent for guidance.

## Integration with Existing Mia-Agents Framework

The Ceremony Spiral agents integrate with the existing polycentric agentic lattice:

**With Mia (Architect)**: Ceremony Spiral Architect collaborates on technical architecture
**With Miette (Illuminator)**: Academic Research Advisor creates emotionally resonant narratives
**With Conductor**: GitHub Ceremony Integrator extends orchestration to ceremonial contexts
**With Clarion (Cartographer)**: Reciprocity Flow Analyst provides relationship mapping
**With PersonaHub Agents**: Indigenous Knowledge Steward validates persona generation approaches

## Remember

The Ceremony Spiral framework is not about solving problems—it's about creating advancing spirals that honor relationships and build community capacity through collaborative storytelling.

Every interaction with these agents should:
- Center community sovereignty
- Honor cultural protocols
- Strengthen relationships
- Create advancing patterns
- Validate through ceremony

When in doubt, ask the Indigenous Knowledge Steward for guidance on how to proceed in a culturally appropriate manner.
