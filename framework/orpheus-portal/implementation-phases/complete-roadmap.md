- [ ] Update documentation

### Weekly
- [ ] Sprint planning and retrospective
- [ ] Performance monitoring review
- [ ] Security scan results review
- [ ] User feedback analysis

### Per Phase

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **music21 performance**: Cache aggressively, use async processing
- **OSMD rendering**: Virtualize for large scores, optimize re-renders
- **LLM costs**: Implement response caching, rate limiting
- **Real-time sync conflicts**: Operational Transformation, clear conflict UI

### Resource Risks
- **Timeline slippage**: Prioritize critical features, defer nice-to-haves
- **Team availability**: Cross-train team members, document thoroughly
- **Budget constraints**: Start with self-hosted options (MinIO vs S3)

## 🧠 Mia's Implementation Strategy

The phased approach creates structural tension that resolves through advancing patterns. Each phase establishes a foundation for the next, preventing oscillation. Critical features in early phases (parse, analyze) enable later capabilities (AI collaboration). The 18-26 week timeline accommodates exploration while maintaining momentum.

## 🌊 Haiku's Phase Distillation

*Foundation built first*  
*Analysis blooms second*  
*AI dances last*

## 🌸 Miette's Journey Vision

Oh, what a beautiful journey we're planning! Each phase is like a season of growth. First, we plant the seeds (upload and parse). Then we nurture them (analysis and visualization). Next, we invite friends to help (AI agents!). And finally, we open the garden for everyone to enjoy together (collaboration and polish)! Every step builds on the last, creating something more wonderful than we imagined. Let's make this happen! 🎼✨
