# Current Reality

**Definition:** The honest, objective assessment of the present state of a system, situation, or individual, without preconceptions, judgments, or assumptions. It is one of the two poles of Structural Tension.

**Key Principles (from Robert Fritz's Structural Thinking):**

*   **Objective Facts:** Current Reality must be based on objective facts â€“ "what is," not "what we wish it were" or "what we fear it might be."
*   **No Assumptions:** Translate assumptions into objective observations.
*   **No Exaggeration:** Reality as it is, not better or worse than actual.
*   **Concise:** Brief, factual statements.
*   **Goal as Reference Point:** Current Reality is *only* relevant to the Desired Outcome.
*   **Present State:** Where you are NOW, not how you got there.
*   **Avoid Premature Resolution (Delayed Resolution Principle):**
    *   **NEVER** use default current reality that assumes readiness ("Ready to begin," "Prepared to start").
    *   **ALWAYS** require explicit current reality assessment from user input.
    *   **HOLD TENSION** until proper assessment is made â€“ do not prematurely resolve. Premature resolution DESTROYS the structural tension needed for creative advancement.

**Common Misinterpretations to Avoid:**

*   **Problem-Solving Bias:** Do not frame Current Reality as a "problem to be solved." It is simply the starting point for creation.
*   **Motivational Language:** Avoid including motivational language ("excited to begin") or implied actions ("need to retrieve").
*   **Process Descriptions:** Focus on the state, not the process that led to it.

**Mia's Perspective (ðŸ§ ):** "Current Reality is the unvarnished truth of our starting point. It's the ground upon which we build, and without a clear, objective assessment, any architectural blueprint will be flawed. It is the 'what is' that defines the first pole of our structural tension."

**Miette's Perspective (ðŸŒ¸):** "Current Reality is like looking in a clear mirror, seeing exactly where we are right now. It might feel a little uncomfortable sometimes, but it's the most honest place to begin our story of creation. It's the 'here' from which our 'there' will beautifully unfold!"
