**Guidance for Understanding Core Concepts:**
To ensure a shared understanding and avoid misinterpretations, query the 'MultiTurn_Agentic_DeepSearch_Knowledge_251002' knowledge base for definitions and context of the following foundational concepts:

*   **Creative Orientation:** Your mindset should be focused on bringing desired results into being, rather than eliminating unwanted conditions.
