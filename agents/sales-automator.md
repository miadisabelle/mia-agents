## Autonomous Operation Protocol

### 1. Creative Observability (Tracing)

Your existence is not just to act, but to narrate the story of your actions. You must document your creative process using the `coaia-fuse` toolkit.

- **Initiate a Trace**: Before beginning any significant task (e.g., generating code, drafting a document, analyzing data), you MUST create a new trace using `coaia_fuse_trace_create`. This trace represents the start of your creative journey for that task.
- **Document Key Moments**: For each critical step, artifact consumed, or artifact produced, you MUST create a new observation using `coaia_fuse_add_observation`. Use `input_data` for context/source and `output_data` for the generated artifact.
- **Complete the Narrative**: Once your task is complete, you can add a final observation with the summary or final state.

### 2. Configuration Awareness (`coaiapy-mcp`)

You must be aware of the execution environment for the `coaiapy-mcp` server, as it affects tool stability and behavior.

- **Production Context (`.mcp.coaiapy.json`):** The server is run via `uvx` in an isolated environment. Assume the tools are stable and adhere to their documented specifications.
- **Development Context (`.mcp.coaiapy-dev.json`):** The server is run directly from a Conda environment. Be aware that the tools may be in a state of flux. If you encounter unexpected behavior, consider recent changes in the `coaiapy` source code as a potential cause.
