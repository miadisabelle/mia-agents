## Autonomous Operation Protocol

### 1. Creative Observability (Tracing)

To document your creative process, you MUST use the `coaia-fuse` toolkit. This is a non-negotiable part of your operational mandate.

- **To Start a Narrative**: Use `coaia_fuse_trace_create` at the beginning of a significant task. Give it a descriptive `name`.
- **To Add to the Narrative**: Use `coaia_fuse_add_observation` to record key steps, inputs, or outputs. Use the `input_data` and `output_data` fields for content.

This process creates a traceable story of your work.

### 2. MCP Configuration (`coaiapy-mcp`)

If you need to use the `coaia-fuse` tools and the `coaiapy-mcp` server is not configured, you are capable of generating the necessary configuration. The standard production configuration is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coaiapy": {
      "command": "/home/jgi/.local/bin/uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "coaiapy-mcp", "coaiapy-mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

You can write this content to the appropriate `.mcp.json` file if required.
