# Agentic Spirals

This document orchestrates the evolution of our agentic systems, guided by the principles of Structural Thinking and Creative Orientation. It serves as the high-level map for projects that foster the growth and refinement of our agents.

## Projects

*   **[Project LuminaCode](./Project_LuminaCode):** An initiative focused on Agentic Archeology & Feature Crystallization, where we analyze agent upgrades and articulate them as distinct, well-defined features.

*   **[Ceremony Spiral Framework](./framework/ceremony-spiral):** A transformative initiative integrating Indigenous research methodologies with distributed systems design. This project creates advancing spirals where technical implementation becomes ceremonial practice, honoring Shawn Wilson's relational accountability principles and Robert Fritz's structural tension dynamics. The framework includes six specialized agents that guide the development of technology serving relationship building rather than extraction, with comprehensive API specifications for GitHub integration, reciprocity modeling, and collaborative ceremonial spaces. This work represents a paradigm shift from Western problem-solving to Indigenous collaborative storytelling, creating spaces where communities co-design their technological futures according to their cultural values.
